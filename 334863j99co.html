<h2 data-label="700576" class="ltx_title_subsection">John's Otitis Media and best treatment</h2><div>John is a ten-year old boy and has earache and he is partially deaf. The doctor has identified that he has fluid in his right middle ear and he has diagnosed that this is due to otitis media with effusion in his ear. He wants to insert a grommet in the ear but he'd also like to review the available literature in order to identify the best evidence for treating this condition so that he will be able to achieve best results and avoid harm for this child. &nbsp;What does he need to do?</div><div>In this paper, we will learn about the GRADE approach to appraise evidence and create an evidence portfolio. We will use the above example to frame a research question, conduct a search of the literature, identify journal articles and existing meta analyses as evidence base, then we will learn to do two things:</div><ol><li>First, we will conduct a meta-analysis to synthesize primary research articles</li><li>Second, we will use the GRADE software to arrive at the best evidence</li></ol><div></div><div>Before we begin, you will need to log in to the following two web apps and walk through the exercises and codes. These are:</div><ul><li>Rstudio instance for HLTH301 (you will have to log on using your own usercode and password for University of Canterbury)</li><li><a href="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/app/" target="_blank">GRADEpro (you will need to use your own username and password by creating an account on the site)</a></li></ul><div>After you have taken the two steps, continue ...</div><div>RStudio is a software that you can use to interact with R. R is a statistical programming language: this means you can use R to do statistical data analysis. Here, we will use R for running a meta analysis on the above topic. You will not need to know the nitty-gritty of R for this tutorial and learning this module. All you will need to do is to copy and paste codes from this page to Rstudio and run the code. I will explain the messages and outputs. Your task with GRADEpro is similar. Please follow the steps outlined here and you will be able to generate the tables and steps.</div><h2 data-label="242406" class="ltx_title_subsection">Step 1: How to conduct a meta analysis</h2><div>The first thing we will learn in this module is to conduct a meta analysis. A meta analysis is a synthesis of information where we obtain numerical data from individual studies and pool the estimates to arrive at a summary estimate. The following steps are involved in the process:</div><ol><li>We identify a specific problem to be solved and frame a PICO formatted search question</li><li>We search the literature databases and identify journal articles that are published in peer-reviewed journals and other studies</li><li>We abstract the study results</li><li></li></ol><div></div>
