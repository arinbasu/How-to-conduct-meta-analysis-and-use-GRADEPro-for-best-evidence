<h2 data-label="700576" class="ltx_title_subsection">John's Otitis Media and best treatment</h2><div>John is a ten-year old boy and has earache and he is partially deaf. The doctor has identified that he has fluid in his right middle ear and he has diagnosed that this is due to otitis media with effusion in his ear. He wants to insert a grommet in the ear but he'd also like to review the available literature in order to identify the best evidence for treating this condition so that he will be able to achieve best results and avoid harm for this child. &nbsp;What does he need to do?</div><div>In this paper, we will learn about the GRADE approach to appraise evidence and create an evidence portfolio. We will use the above example to frame a research question, conduct a search of the literature, identify journal articles and existing meta analyses as evidence base, then we will learn to do two things:</div><ol><li>First, we will conduct a meta-analysis to synthesize primary research articles</li><li>Second, we will use the GRADE software to arrive at the best evidence</li></ol><div></div><div>Before we begin, you will need to log in to the following two web apps and walk through the exercises and codes. These are:</div><ul><li>Rstudio instance for HLTH301 (you will have to log on using your own usercode and password for University of Canterbury)</li><li><a href="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/app/" target="_blank">GRADEpro (you will need to use your own username and password by creating an account on the site)</a></li></ul><div>After you have taken the two steps, continue ...</div><div>RStudio is a software that you can use to interact with R. R is a statistical programming language: this means you can use R to do statistical data analysis. Here, we will use R for running a meta analysis on the above topic. You will not need to know the nitty-gritty of R for this tutorial and learning this module. All you will need to do is to copy and paste codes from this page to Rstudio and run the code. I will explain the messages and outputs. Your task with GRADEpro is similar. Please follow the steps outlined here and you will be able to generate the tables and steps.</div><h2 data-label="242406" class="ltx_title_subsection">Part 1: How to conduct a meta analysis</h2><div>The first thing we will learn in this module is to conduct a meta analysis. A meta analysis is a synthesis of information where we obtain numerical data from individual studies and pool the estimates to arrive at a summary estimate. Meta analysis is synthesis and pooling of results from primary studies to arrive at a summary estimate. Here, we pool or sum up the results from primary studies. We have learned so far that:</div><ul><li>Evidence based medicine or evidence based health care is application of the best available evidence in the context of health care</li><li>When we apply this process to a real world problem we frame an answerable question, and then on the basis of that question, we conduct a search of scholarly literature andcritically appraise the evidence presented in the literature</li><li>Critical appraisal of the literature is where we read each article and then try to identify the different biases in the study. Biases refer to the errors or misclassifications in the exposed and unexposed populations, or those who received an intervention and those who did not receive interventions.&nbsp;</li><li>We have learned that an association between X and Y is a valid association if it satisfies three following criteria:</li><li>If the association can rule out the play of chance</li><li>If the association is free of biases</li><li>If in establishing the association the investigator has controlled for confounding variables</li><li>Even though we can establish that X and Y have a valid association, this does not mean that the nature of such an association is one of cause and effect, that is, X does not necessarily cause Y even if X is validly associated with Y.&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div><div>Meta analysis consists of the following steps.&nbsp;</div><ol><li>Frame an answerable question using PICO</li><li>Search for relevant studies using search terms derived from PICO terms</li><li>Establish selection criteria (inclusion and exclusion criteria)</li><li>Exclude articles on the basis of titles and abstracts</li><li>Retain the full text of the remaining articles</li><li>Abstract information from the full text of the other articles</li><li>Search for more articles and studies based on the reference lists of these articles</li><li>Test if the studies are heterogeneous (conduct tests of heterogeneity)</li><li>Pool the effect estimates from the studies</li><li>Conduct subgroup analyses based on specific criteria</li><li>Test if you were able to capture big and small studies (test for publication bias)</li></ol><div></div><div>We will illustrate these 11 steps with the example above where we shall conduct a meta analysis of the effectiveness of grommet insertion for children with otitis media with effusion.&nbsp;</div><div>Step 1: Frame an answerable question using PICO</div><div>The term "PICO" is an abbreviation for Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcomes. The word population here represents the people to whom the results of a study is applicable. In the example above, we are interested to study or conduct a meta analysis of all interventions that are grommet insertions for children or adolescents. Hence the population in our example consists of adolescents or children, both boys and girls, all ethnicity and socioeconomic status. "I" in this terminology stands for "intervention". In the example above, intervention is "grommet insertion". Grommets are also referred to as pressure equalising tubes. These tubes are inserted by making a slit in the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and left for about six months after which these tubes are taken out. &nbsp;"C" here refers to comparative procedure or another procedure. In the present example, this is c</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
